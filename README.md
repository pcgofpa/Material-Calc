<h1 align="center"> Material-Calc </h1>

Capstone project to finish my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The idea for this project came from my friend asking me if I could make a calculator for him to make it easier for him to calculate the amount of materials required to build fences at work.

<h2 align="center"> Project Idea </h2>

This project will be created within Android Studio as a mobile application that can be installed on Android Devices and used by both contractors and do-it-yourself home improvement users. 

For contractors this application can assist with generating quotes as this application will calculate the number of posts, pickets, and runners that you will need to build your customer's fence.

  Example of the Flooring Material Calculator screen. The floor material calculator calculates the area provided by the user. It then adds 10% to the area before giving the user
  a square footage to order. The extra 10% is to account for errors in cutting the materials, or sections of the material that is bad.
